## üìä Executive Summary

This project analyzes alleged gender discrimination in salary and promotion practices at Houston College of Medicine using rigorous statistical methods. Through comprehensive data analysis of **261 faculty members**, we debunk claims of systemic gender bias by demonstrating that **experience and department‚Äînot gender‚Äîare the decisive factors** determining compensation and rank.

**Key Findings:**
- **No evidence of gender discrimination** in salary or promotions when controlling for relevant factors
- **Experience is the sole decisive factor** for high earners (top 25%)
- Women work **~80.5% of men's hours** (51 vs 62 hours/week), explaining promotion timing differences
- Women are **overrepresented in lower-paying departments**, not systematically underpaid
- **Salary growth rates are identical** for both genders (9.8% vs 10.0%)

**Legal Implication:** The data does not support claims of systematic gender-based discrimination at Houston College of Medicine.

---

## üéØ Business Problem

**Context:** Houston College of Medicine faces a gender discrimination lawsuit alleging:
1. Women receive lower salaries than men for equivalent work
2. Women experience slower promotion timelines
3. Systematic bias exists in compensation decisions

**Objective:** Use data analytics to determine whether observed salary and rank differences are due to:
- **Discriminatory practices** (gender bias), OR
- **Legitimate factors** (experience, department, role type)

## üîç Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation

**Variables:**
- **Department:** Biochemistry, Physiology, Genetics, Pediatrics, Medicine, Surgery
- **Gender:** Female (106), Male (155)
- **Clinical Emphasis:** Research (101) vs Clinical (160)
- **Certification:** Board Certified (188) vs Not Certified (73)
- **Rank:** Assistant (112), Associate (64), Full Professor (85)
- **Experience:** Years since PhD (0-35 years)
- **Salary:** 1994 & 1995 compensation

**Data Quality:**
- No missing values
- No duplicate records
- Consistent data formats

### 2. Descriptive Analytics

#### Staff Demographics

| Category | Distribution | Key Insight |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Gender** | 41% Female, 59% Male | Proportions vary significantly by department |
| **Ranks** | 43% Assistant, 25% Associate, 32% Full Prof | Experience strongly correlates with rank |
| **Experience** | Junior (0-7): 38%, Mid (7-12): 29%, Senior (12+): 33% | Women average 7.5 years, men 12.1 years |
| **Departments** | Medicine (31%), Biochemistry (19%), Surgery (15%), etc. | Salary ranges: $91k (Physiology) to $319k (Surgery) |

#### Salary Distribution Analysis

```
Average Salary by Department (1995):
- Surgery:        $319,218 (88% male)
- Medicine:       $200,000 (62% male)
- Pediatrics:     $150,000 (67% female)
- Biochemistry:   $120,000 (60% male)
- Genetics:       $110,000 (52% female)
- Physiology:     $91,218 (50/50 split)
```

**Key Finding:** Salary differences correlate with **department choice**, not gender within departments.

### 3. Adjusted Experience Analysis

**Problem:** Raw experience years don't account for actual working hours.

**Solution:** Adjust experience based on Stanford (1996) research showing:
- **Female doctors:** 51 hours/week √ó 46 weeks/year = 2,346 hours/year
- **Male doctors:** 62 hours/week √ó 47 weeks/year = 2,914 hours/year
- **Female workload:** ~80.5% of male workload

**Formula:**
```
Exper_Actual = Exper_Basic √ó (51/62) √ó (46/47)
```

**Result:** When adjusted for actual working hours, **women's promotion patterns align with men's**.

## üìà Statistical Analysis

### 1. Chi-Square Tests: Rank vs Gender

**Hypothesis:** Does gender correlate with rank within experience groups?

| Experience Group | Chi-Square P-value | Interpretation |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **0-7 years** | 0.057 | No significant correlation |
| **7-12 years** | 0.012** | Significant at Œ±=0.05 |
| **12+ years** | 0.465 | No significant correlation |

**Follow-up for 7-12 years group:**
- Chi-square test: **Salary Level vs Gender** ‚Üí p = 0.595
- **Conclusion:** Within this group, salary (not gender) is the more critical variable explaining rank differences

### 2. Promotion Timeline Analysis

**Average Years Required for Promotion (Adjusted Experience):**

| Promotion Stage | Female | Male | Difference |
|-----------------|--------|------|------------|
| Assistant ‚Üí Associate | 2.9 years | 4.3 years | **Women promoted faster** |
| Associate ‚Üí Full Professor | 2.9 years | 3.3 years | **Women promoted faster** |

**Statistical Test:** No significant correlation between gender and promotion (p > 0.05 for most experience groups)

### 3. Simple Linear Regression

#### Model A: Salary ~ Gender
```r
lm(Sal95 ~ Gender, data = data_clean)
```

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Coefficient (Male)** | $64,037 | Men earn more on average |
| **P-value** | 3.64e-9*** | Statistically significant |
| **Adj R¬≤** | 0.1226 | Explains only **12.3%** of variance |

**Problem:** "Significance ‚â† Large effect"‚ÄîGender appears significant but explains very little salary variation.

#### Model B: Salary ~ Experience
```r
lm(Sal95 ~ Exper, data = data_clean)
```

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Coefficient (Exper)** | $4,547/year | Each year adds $4,547 |
| **P-value** | 1.39e-7*** | Highly significant |
| **Adj R¬≤** | 0.0983 | Explains 9.8% of variance |

### 4. Multivariable Linear Regression (Full Model)

```r
lm(Sal95 ~ Gender + Dept + Rank + Exper + Prate + Cert + Clin, data = data_clean)
```

**Results:**

| Variable | P-value | Significance | Interpretation |
|----------|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Gender** | 0.423 | ‚ùå Not significant | Gender does not predict salary |
| **Department** | | | |
| - Physiology | 0.033* | ‚úÖ Significant | Lower salary vs baseline |
| - Genetics | 0.003** | ‚úÖ Significant | Lower salary vs baseline |
| - Pediatrics | 0.037* | ‚úÖ Significant | Lower salary vs baseline |
| - Medicine | 2.91e-15*** | ‚úÖ Highly significant | Higher salary |
| - Surgery | 2e-16*** | ‚úÖ Highly significant | Highest salary |
| **Rank (Linear)** | 1.28e-10*** | ‚úÖ Highly significant | Strong predictor |
| **Experience** | 4.81e-16*** | ‚úÖ Highly significant | **Strongest predictor** |
| **Certification** | 4.09e-6*** | ‚úÖ Significant | Board certified earn more |
| **Clinical Emphasis** | 0.029* | ‚úÖ Significant | Clinical emphasis earns more |

**Model Fit:** Adj R¬≤ = **0.90** (explains 90% of salary variation)

**Conclusion:** Once career structure is controlled, **gender has no independent effect on salary**.

### 5. Logistic Regression: High Salary Group (Top 25%)

```r
glm(high_salary ~ Gender + Dept + Rank + Exper + Prate + Cert + Clin,
    family = binomial, data = mod_df)
```

**Results:**

| Variable | P-value | Significance | Odds Ratio Interpretation |
|----------|---------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Gender** | 0.602 | ‚ùå Not significant | Gender does not predict high earnings |
| **Experience** | 0.00564** | ‚úÖ Significant | **Only significant predictor** (OR ‚âà 1.38) |
| Department | 0.99+ | ‚ùå Not significant | No effect within high earners |
| Certification | 0.103 | ‚ùå Not significant | No effect within high earners |
| Clinical Emphasis | 0.395 | ‚ùå Not significant | No effect within high earners |

**Conclusion:** For top earners, **experience is the sole decisive factor**. Gender plays no role.

## üî¨ Technical Highlights

### Advanced R Techniques

**1. Custom Experience Adjustment Function**
```r
calc_actual_experience <- function(data) {
  data %>%
    mutate(
      weekly_hours = ifelse(Gender == "Male", 62, 51),
      annual_weeks = ifelse(Gender == "Male", 47, 46),
      annual_actual_hours = weekly_hours * annual_weeks,
      actual_hours_total = annual_actual_hours * Exper,
      male_annual_hours = 62 * 47,
      actual_years_male_base = round(actual_hours_total / male_annual_hours, 2)
    )
}
```

**2. Multivariable Regression with Factor Variables**
```r
# Handling ordered factors (Rank) properly
data_clean <- data_clean %>%
  mutate(Rank = factor(Rank, 
                       levels = c("Assistant", "Associate", "Full Professor"),
                       ordered = TRUE))

# Full regression model
m2 <- lm(Sal95 ~ Gender + Dept + Rank + Exper + Prate + Cert + Clin,
         data = data_clean)
```

**3. Logistic Regression for High Salary Group**
```r
# Define top 25% as "high salary"
q75 <- quantile(mod_df$Sal95, 0.75, na.rm = TRUE)
mod_df <- mod_df %>%
  mutate(high_salary = ifelse(Sal95 > q75, 1, 0))

# Logistic model
m_sal_a <- glm(high_salary ~ Gender + Rank + Exper + Dept + Clin + Cert + Prate,
               family = binomial, data = mod_df)
```

## üìã Detailed Findings

### Finding 1: No Gender Pay Gap Within Departments

**Evidence:**
- Average salary comparison **by department, gender, and adjusted experience** shows **no systematic differences**
- Example: In Surgery (highest-paying dept), 7-12 year experience group:
  - Female average: $290,000
  - Male average: $295,000
  - Difference: 1.7% (not statistically significant)

**Visual Proof:** See Slide 9 presentation chart showing overlapping salary bars across all departments.

### Finding 2: Women Are Promoted Faster (Adjusted Hours)

**Evidence:**
- After adjusting for actual working hours:
  - Assistant ‚Üí Associate: Women 2.9 years vs Men 4.3 years
  - Associate ‚Üí Full Professor: Women 2.9 years vs Men 3.3 years

**Chi-Square Results:**
- No significant gender-rank correlation in most experience groups
- Where correlation exists (7-12 years), **salary** is the confounding variable, not gender

### Finding 3: Experience Explains Everything

**Regression Evidence:**

| Model | R¬≤ | Gender Significance | Experience Significance |
|-------|-----|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Gender only | 0.123 | p < 0.001*** | N/A |
| Experience only | 0.098 | N/A | p < 0.001*** |
| **Full model** | **0.90** | **p = 0.423** ‚ùå | **p < 0.001*** ‚úÖ** |

**Interpretation:**
- Gender appears significant in isolation due to **confounding with experience**
- Once experience, department, rank, etc. are controlled, gender effect disappears
- Experience remains the strongest predictor across all models

### Finding 4: Department Choice Matters

**Women's Department Distribution:**
- 67% in Pediatrics (avg salary: $150k)
- 52% in Genetics (avg salary: $110k)
- 50% in Physiology (avg salary: $91k)

**Men's Department Distribution:**
- 88% in Surgery (avg salary: $319k)
- 62% in Medicine (avg salary: $200k)
- 60% in Biochemistry (avg salary: $120k)

**Note:** These choices may reflect **personal preferences, specialization interests, or work-life balance priorities**‚Äînot discriminatory hiring practices.

### Finding 5: Identical Salary Growth

**1994-1995 Salary Increase:**
- Female doctors: 10.0% average
- Male doctors: 9.8% average
- Statistical test: p = 0.89 (no significant difference)

**Implication:** Current salary practices show **no evidence of ongoing discrimination**.

---

## üéì Legal & Statistical Interpretation

### Statistical Significance vs Practical Significance

**Important Distinction:**
- **Statistical significance (p-value)** tells us if an effect exists
- **Effect size (R¬≤)** tells us if the effect is meaningful

**In this case:**
- Gender has a **statistically significant** effect in simple regression (p < 0.001)
- BUT it explains only **12.3% of variance** (very small effect)
- When proper controls are added, the effect **disappears entirely** (p = 0.423)

### Simpson's Paradox in Action

This case demonstrates **Simpson's Paradox**:
- **Aggregate level:** Women earn less on average ($130k vs $160k)
- **Disaggregated level:** Women earn the same within department-experience groups

**Explanation:** The aggregate difference is due to **compositional effects** (women in lower-paying depts with less experience), not discrimination.

### Legal Standard for Discrimination

**Requirements to prove discrimination:**
1. ‚úÖ Disparity exists (e.g., salary gap)
2. ‚ùå Disparity cannot be explained by legitimate factors
3. ‚ùå Evidence of discriminatory intent or practice

**Verdict:** This analysis demonstrates that observed disparities **CAN be explained by legitimate factors** (experience, department, hours worked), failing requirement #2.

## üìä Results Summary

| Claim | Finding | Statistical Evidence |
|-------|---------|---------------------|
| **Women earn less than men** | TRUE in aggregate, FALSE within groups | Simple regression: p < 0.001; Full model: p = 0.423 |
| **Women are promoted slower** | FALSE (when adjusted for hours) | Chi-square: p > 0.05; Promotion time: Women faster |
| **Gender predicts salary** | FALSE (when controlling for structure) | Multivariate R¬≤ = 0.90, gender p = 0.423 |
| **Experience predicts salary** | TRUE (sole decisive factor) | All models: p < 0.001, Logistic: OR = 1.38 |
| **Department predicts salary** | TRUE (explains most variance) | Surgery $319k vs Physiology $91k |
| **Systematic discrimination exists** | **NO EVIDENCE** | All tests fail to show gender effect after controls |
